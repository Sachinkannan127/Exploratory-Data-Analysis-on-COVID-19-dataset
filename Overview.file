1. Import necessary Libraries 

2. Load Dataset

3. Data Cleaning 
● Check for missing/null values. 
● Fill or drop missing data as appropriate. 
● Remove duplicates. 
● Standardize column names (lowercase, replace spaces with underscores)

4. Data Preprocessing 
● Convert date columns to datetime. 
● Create new features (e.g., active cases = confirmed - deaths - recovered). 
● Group by country or continent for aggregation. 

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
In this part, you will explore the cleaned dataset to find patterns and insights using 
visualizations. 
1. Top 10 Countries by Confirmed Cases 
● Group the data by Country. 
● Find the total or maximum confirmed cases for each country. 
● Select the top 10 countries with the highest number of cases. 
● Visualize this using a bar chart to compare their case counts. 
2. Trend of Cases Over Time 
● Use the Date column to analyze how confirmed cases have changed over time. 
● Plot a line graph showing the trend of total confirmed cases. 
● You can focus on a few selected countries or show global totals. 
3. Correlation Between Numerical Columns 
● Identify numeric columns like Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, Tests, etc. 
● Find how these variables are related to each other using correlation. 
● Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap. 
4. Continent-Level Analysis 
● If your dataset includes or can be grouped by Continent, analyze data for each 
continent. 
● Compare total cases, deaths, or recovery rates using a pie chart or bar chart. 
● This helps visualize how the pandemic affected different regions. 
Expected Outcome 
● A clean, well-structured dataset. 
● Insightful visualizations (trends, comparisons, correlations). 
● A brief report or notebook summarizing your findings
